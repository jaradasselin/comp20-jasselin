I have correctly implemented this assignment. The video plays, and the lyrics Mariah should be
singing appear below the video when she should be singing them. It took me about four hours to 
complete this assignment, because I was learning Javascript as I went along. It also took about a
half hour to figure out what words she was trying to sing because she performed so poorly. 

index.html contains the HTML and Javascript for a webpage that shows Mariah Carey's
performance at the 2016 New Years Eve in NYC, which she bombed. index.html is responsible for 
all of the text on the page, including the words beneath the video which represent the lyrics
Mariah intended to sing during this performance. The webpage is titled "Fail".

style.css contains the CSS styling for the webpage "Fail". It includes some font changes, centering
of the text and video, and a background of Mariah Carey's hit album "The Emancipation of Mimi".

mimicover.jpg is the album cover of "The Emancipation of Mimi" by Mariah Carey.
